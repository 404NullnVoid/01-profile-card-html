    <h2>Graphic Designer| Beginner Web Designer| Illustrator</h2>
    <p>What's up! I'm a graphic designer and marketing enthusiast with a passion for bringing ideas to life through both print and digital media. Whether it’s designing eye-catching holiday cards or creating marketing ads that make people stop scrolling, I love crafting visuals that connect. I’ve found success in a range of creative projects, from cheerful holiday printables to polished digital graphics. Right now, I’m diving into the world of web coding, expanding my skills and feeding my love of learning. When I’m not designing, you can find me curled up with a good book, sipping coffee, and enjoying a rainy day — my favorite creative fuel. I’m always exploring new ideas, hobbies, and ways to grow. Let’s create something great together!</p>
